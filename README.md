# Sniper 3d Bank Cancellation
 
 
The Bank of America near Bell Tower shops reopened on Feb 20, two weeks after a man who tried to rob the bank was shot by a sniper, people who bank at the branch said they see noticeable security measures and changes in the form of a uniformed guard at the front.

Newly released footage from Florida police shows the incredible moment a sniper shot a bank robber, with the bullet traveling through a desktop computer and between two hostages before fatally striking the suspect.

New footage from the bank robbery that occurred earlier this year surfaced online and showed the intense standoff between police and the man holding two hostages. Officers from the Lee County Sheriff's Department descended upon a Bank of America in Fort Myers, Florida, in full armor and met with the 36-year-old bank robber inside the building.

A negotiator can be heard talking to the man who, at one point, used the two hostages as shields while the sniper was getting into position right outside the room. "Keep talking to me, keep talking to me, I want to know what's going through your head right now," the negotiator said.
 
The negotiation attempts weren't enough to have the man stand down, and he proceeded to put one of the hostages in a headlock while holding a knife at their neck. The sniper reacted quickly and took a seemingly impossible shot where the bullet went through a desktop screen, in between the two hostages, and into the bank robber's forehead. The suspect fell to the ground while the hostages ran for cover, and the police team threw flash-bang grenades before entering the room.
 
"Shooting positions like these are trained regularly by snipers for time-critical incidents like these," said Lt. Todd Olmer of the Lee County Sheriff's Office in a statement. "Due to the suspect's limited exposure, the sniper took a planned and deliberate shot through a computer monitor, striking the suspect in the center of the forehead, killing him instantly."
 
He added, "Firing through barriers is a trained and routinely practiced skill by the Lee County Sheriff's Office special operations unit snipers. The .308-caliber bullet used is specifically selected due to its known ballistic reliability traveling through intermediate barriers."
 
The Bosnian War was an incredibly complicated conflict. Three distinct groups of citizens lived together peacefully in Yugoslavia, the Muslim Bosniaks, Orthodox Christmas Serbs and Catholic Croats. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the instabilities in Yugoslavia worsened and it began to separate into independent states. This erupted into violence in 1992 and led to the beginning of the conflict.
 
Officially called Ljubljanska Banka Tower, this concrete block was used as a bank during the Soviet era when Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of Yugoslavia. When thew ar broke out in Mostar, it became the sniper nest for the western bank. Snipers got a clear view across the river valley into the eastern half, taking potshots at will. During the conflict, around 2000 people died in Mostar and some were shot from this very tower.
 
There is a makeshift pile of rocks and bricks. If you are short like us, be prepared to use your arms to hoist yourself up. Coming back the other way is easier as the pile is bigger and there is a brick halfway up the wall for an extra boost.
 
As you head up, each floor offers an opportunity to explore and check out some of the cool artwork. There is plenty of aimless tagging going on, but next to these are some fantastic large scale pieces.
 
You may notice that much of it has an anti-war message (not that much on here but in the building itself). It is this detail that brings you back to the stark realisation that this was the scene of otrcities. Before it was sprayed with paint it was sprayed with bullets. Lone men, armed with long range guns picked off civilians rushing through the streets of eastern Mostar. It is chilling.
 
If you need to lighten up after that moment of reflection, just head up to the top floors and take in the stunning view. You can see out across the whole city. This is especially fun if you have visited other areas of the city first. As the city is tucked into a river valley, it is all edged neatly in green swatches that stretch to the sky. On a sunny day, it is magnificent. On a dull one? Well, its atmospheric I guess.
 
There are days on holiday when a little cocktail with lunch is a great idea but this is not one of them. Steep drops with no handrails do not mix with booze so wait until you are safely back at ground level to hit happy hour.
